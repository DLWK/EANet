## Overview
### 1.2. Abstract
Accurate and automatic segmentation of medical images can greatly assist the
clinical diagnosis and analysis. However, it remains a challenging task due to (1)
the diversity of scale in the medical image targets and (2) the complex context
environments of medical images, including ambiguity of structural boundaries,
complexity of shapes, and the heterogeneity of textures. To comprehensively
tackle these challenges, we propose a novel and effective iterative edge attention
network (EANet) for medical image segmentation with steps as follows. First,
we propose a dynamic scale-aware context (DSC) module, which dynamically
adjusts the receptive fields to extract multi-scale contextual information efficiently. Second, an edge-attention preservation (EAP) module is employed to
guide effectively removes noise and helps the edge stream focus on processing
only the boundary-related information. Finally, a multi-level pairwise regression
(MPR) module is designed to combine the complementary edge and region information for refining the ambiguous structure. This iterative optimization helps
to learn better representations and more accurate saliency maps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network achieves superior segmentation performance to state-of-the-art methods in four different challenging medical segmentation tasks, including lung nodule segmentation, COVID-19 infection segmentation, lung segmentation, and
thyroid nodule segmentation.

    Figure 1: Overview of the proposed EANet. Our network is in an encoder-decoder style,
it consists of the VGG-19 feature encoder E1 âˆ¼ E5, dynamic scale-aware context (DSC) module, edge attention preservation (EAP) module, the feature decoder
D1 âˆ¼ D5 and multilevel pairwise regression (MPR) module. HFF denotes hybrid feature fusion block, which is
a component of MPR. The final prediction is the generated global map (Sg) after iterative
optimization by combining edge information and region information. The Si, {i = 2, 3, 4, 5}
indicates the feature map of the side-output laye.
